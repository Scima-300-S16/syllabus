		<br /><br /> 
		 <span class="weekly3">Assignment Due: </span><br />
			 A1a :: Data Selfie :: <br />
			 1) Collect ALL your digital communications from a 72 hour timeblock (you can do longer if you need more data, but not shorter) and organize them in a spreadsheet. <strong>Use a minimum of 12 metadata categories to organize this collection.</strong> You are not sharing the content of your collected data, but the metadata, the "data about the data": time, date, location, medium etc. Are they: email, chat, twitter, social network sites, listserves, blogs, text messages and phone/voicemail? What types of relationships (immediate family member, close friend, acquaintance, etc.) are you communicating with? What kinds of conversations and data exchanges did you have; were they executables, coordinating a physical meeting, gossip, intimate or humourous...? Are the messages short or long? Classify the contexts (from bed, campus, class, cafe) and mood. A truly excellent work will conceive of innovative categories for classification and analysis in addition to the ones above. In addition to the above, you will need a "unique identifier" for each row or entry. This is usually a unique number (incrementing by 1) that is assigned to each row. Make the unique identifier the first column on your spreadsheet.<br />
			 2) Write 1-2 paragraphs on your initial observations about your 72 hour digital communication data. Are there certain patterns that you see? If someone who didn't know you were to read this data, what would they conclude about you?<br />
			 Put work into a folder called A1a_lastname_firstname and them compress so that your zip file is A1a_lastname_firstname.zip and bring into class. (note: this is categorized as an Assignment (A) rather than an Homework (Hw)) <br />
			 **note: If you are unfamiliar with using spreadsheets please spend some extra time familiarizing yourself with how they work and with the reading above.
			  
		 <br /><br />
		 IN CLASS:<br />
		 - Variables<br />
		 - Review Hw. <br />
		 -  Review A1a. What observations were made?<br />
	     - Identify variable types for the kinds of data you have. Make notes for how the data could be understood visually <br />

		  - make new sheets (w/in same spreadsheet) with just the data you need for 3 types visualizations (make one location based). Please indicate somewhere what kind of visualization you are envisioning for each sheet. make sure to keep a unique id for each row that is consistent with your original sheet's rows.<br />
		   - Revise your artistic programming-tutorial-without-code if necessary.<br />
		  - Register with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, using your cca email. Opt for a free account if prompted.<br />

		 - if you've never used the command line before, you may need to read up a bit: <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">Command Line for Mac</a>, or <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/windows-command-prompt-introduction/">Command Line for Windows</a><br />
		 Do:<br />
		  - A1c :: Finish mapping some data from your digital data selfie. You can use location to show actual location of communication, or have the map be somewhat abstract, representing platform or receiver, for example. The size of the bubbles should represent some aspect of your data, like amount of use. Consider using color as representing some other aspec of your visual, like dominant mood as related to location. Use TSV or CSV files. Submit work via email.
		 <br />
		 <br />IN CLASS:<br />
		  - review maps<br />
		  - continue basic review of programming - <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/">arrays (just check out the first 3 sections )</a>, <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/objects/">object oriented programming</a><br />

		 Do:<br />
		  - this week you have a couple of options. you may continue to develop your map and data visualizations, visualizing new data sets derived from your data selfie, or you may work with new code offered in the reading and <a href="media/wk5.zip">here</a> to visualize some data from your data selfie over time. If you are really stuck with the code, please be in touch and we can come up with the right approach for your level. Upload your work into the A1d repository on GitHub here : <a href="https://github.com/SCIMA-300">https://github.com/SCIMA-300</a>with the lastname_firstname naming schema (following the <a href="https://github.com/SCIMA-300/directions_for_submitting_work/blob/master/DIRECTIONS.md">instructions above</a>)<br />
		 <br />IN CLASS:<br />
		 - more basic programming review<br /> <!--also review map(), using a for loop to move through an array, getFloat(), getRowCount() 
		 - review homework, look at examples<br /> <!--where are we in acquire/parse/filter/mine/represent/refine/interact? what is the next step? where to get something interesting? review classic graph types
		  - Making meaning with quantitative info. showing quantitative info visually, using tags and labels. see fry, ch 4, also text(), rect(), textSize(), fill(), etc. 
		 - Studio time: Play with <a href="media/wk5_code_examples.zip">sample code of arrays and objects</a><br />
		 - Assess where you are in the process visualizing your data selfie in terms of Ben Fry's <em>acquire > parse > filter > mine > represent > refine > interact</em>, and where you need to go next in order to represent some aspect of your data selfie in a meaningful way. Do you need to go back to <em>acquire</em> and generate a wholly new data set? or just back to <em>filter</em> to sift through data you have and represent it in a new way? Or, are you ready to <em>refine</em> your visualization? Decide what is next, define your goal for the next week and then list out the steps to getting there and also identify your biggest challenge. Post this list of steps to <a href="https://github.com/SCIMA-300/c5">the c5 repository on GitHub</a> <br />

		 Do:<br />
		 - For your A1e visualization you have 3 options to appraoch your selfie. 1) You can go back to the <em>acquire</em> step (defined by Ben Fry) and use new data from your digital data selfie to make a new visualization (possibly using the connections and correlations code above), or 2) you can <em>filter</em> data you've already been working on to generate a more meaningful visualization, or 3) you may be ready to <em>refine</em> your visualization and add more interaction. Add your work to the <a href="https://github.com/SCIMA-300/A1e">A1e repository before class</a><br /> 
		 
		 <br />IN CLASS:<br />
		  <em>for the first half of class::</em> <br />
		   - 1) work out any final issues you have with A1-A1e. Refine and add interactivity and/ or movement with whatever code you are working on.<br />
		  - 2) consider directionality. Using illustrator, pop-ups within Processing, or simple shapes and lines (that draw for a TSV file or not), demonstrate the directions of your messages. Add your work to the c6 github repository, or zip up and email.<br />
		  <em>for the second half of class::</em><br />
		  - 3) start thinking about how to organize your A2 data

		 <span class="weekly3">Assignment 2: </span><br />
			  - A2a :: Analog Data Selfie :: <br />
			  - Visualize your analog communications: Document your analog communications for a 24 hour time period. How do you communicate to drivers and bikers when crossing the street on foot, when ordering coffee in a busy shop, or late at night in a rough neighborhood. Consider vocal and non vocal communications. You may use some categories/ metadata that you used for your digital observations, but you will also need to add new ones. Note the difficulty in establishing metadata categories for non-digital communications. Organize your categories in a spreadsheet, TSV, or CSV as in A1, label A2_lastname_firstname and put in GitHub or zip up and email to professor before class.

		 <br />BEFORE CLASS:<br />
		
		 Do:<br />
		  - Consider your A2a analog communication data. You may work in any visual environment you wish to visualize your non-digital communications. How do you understand context, meaning and shared understanding in these communications? In the next few weeks we will work on visualizing and quantifying this data in various ways, but this week you can be creative and think outside of the box in regards to your visualizations. Share all Processing sketches via the A2b github repository, or send sketches, drawings or vector graphics via email.<br />
