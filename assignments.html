	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 1: <br />
	 A1a :: Digital Data Selfie Part A ::</span><br />
	 Collect ALL your digital communications from a 72 hour timeblock (you can do longer if you need more data, but not shorter) and organize them in a spreadsheet. <li> - Use a minimum of 12 metadata categories to organize this collection.</strong> You are not sharing the content of your collected data, but the metadata, the "data about the data": time, date, location, medium etc. </li>
	 <li> - Some possible questions to ask yourself when structuring your metadata: Are your communications email, chat, twitter, social network sites, listserves, blogs, text messages and phone/voicemail? What types of relationships (immediate family member, close friend, acquaintance, etc.) are you communicating with? What kinds of conversations and data exchanges did you have; were they executables, coordinating a physical meeting, gossip, intimate or humourous...? Are the messages short or long? Classify the contexts (from bed, campus, class, cafe) and mood. A truly excellent work will conceive of innovative categories for classification and analysis in addition to the ones above. </li>
	 <li> - You will need a "unique identifier" for each row or entry. This is usually a number (starting at 0 and incrementing by 1) that is assigned to each row. Make the unique identifier the first column on your spreadsheet.</li>
	  <li>Write 1-2 paragraphs on your initial observations about your 72 hour digital communication data. Are there certain patterns that you see? If someone who didn't know you were to read this data, what would they conclude about you?</li>
	 <li>Label file A1a_lastname_firstname.filetype and submit to the A1 folder within SCIMA-300-S16 in Google Drive. If you are unfamiliar with using spreadsheets you will need to spend extra time with this assignment. Please note the spreadsheet resources on the schedule page.</li>
	 Due before class Feb 01.
	 <br /><br />
	 	 
	 A1b :: Digital Data Selfie Part B :: <br />	 
	 Using the software or programming environment of your choice, visualize your digital communications. You may use some kind of chart or map, or get creative with how you visualize your data. Do however, make the elements of your visual (size, color, position) directly correspond to your data set. Make 1-2 sketches. <br />
	 Label file A1b_lastname_firstname.filetype and submit to the A1 folder within SCIMA-300-S16 in Google Drive. 
	 <br />Due before class Feb 08.
	 <br /><br /><br />
	 
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 2: <br />
	 A2a :: Non-Digital Communications Selfie Part A</span><br />
	 Document your analog communications for a 24 hour time period. How do you communicate to drivers and bikers when crossing the street on foot, when ordering coffee in a busy shop, or late at night in a rough neighborhood. Consider vocal and non vocal communications. You may use some categories/ metadata that you used for your digital observations, but you will also need to add new ones. Note the difficulty in establishing metadata categories for non-digital communications. Organize your categories in a spreadsheet, TSV, or CSV.<br /><br />
 	A2b :: Non-Digital Communications Selfie Part B<br />
 	Consider your A2a analog communication data. You may work in any visual environment you wish to visualize your non-digital communications. How do you understand context, meaning and shared understanding in these communications? Be creative and think outside of the box in regards to your visualizations. Do however, make the elements of your visual (size, color, position) directly correspond to your data set. Make 1-2 sketches. <br />
	 Zip up all work and label file A2_lastname_firstname.filetype and submit to the A2 folder within SCIMA-300-S16 in Google Drive. 
	 <br />Due before class Feb 15.
	 
	 <br /><br />
	 
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 3: <br />
	 A3:: Putting it all together</span><br />
	 Work on creating a meaningful story with your data. Make a one page story using minimum of 2 large visuals (presumably 1 visual from A1 and 1 visual from A2), with smaller visuals indicating at least one different level of the data (zooming in on a subset of the data) as needed. Make sure all elements of your data are properly labeled. Your project should be meaningful in that it shows differences and changes in data and between data sets. This can be created in the environment of your choice. 
	 <br /><br />
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 4: <br />
	 A4:: Displaying data using Processing and the Table object </span><br />
	 March 14-April 11<br />
	 Working in Processing and using the Table object, use the sample code from Ch03 nd Ch04 of Visualizing Data, by Ben Fry. This code is offered on the <a href="https://github.com/Scima-300-S16">course GitHub page</a>. Ch03 visualizes quantities on a map, and Ch04 visualizes changes in data over time. Modify both examples using your own data. Choose either bubbles_on_a_map or tracking_data_over_time to modify significantly, changing not only the data but color, shape, movement, etc. Make sure this developed example is well labeled, with a title and other labels as needed to clarify the information for the viewer.<br />
	 You may work with the data generated from your selfies, or use other data sets. See a partial list on the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.<br />
	 
	 Due before class April 11. Push to GitHub or upload in the Google Drive course folders.
	 <br /><br />
	 
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 5: </span><br />
	 Take one significant visualization you have done to date from A1-A4, and develop a pullout or "level" that takes a closer look at some aspect of your data.<br />
	 For most if not all of you, your data visualizations have generated questions for further investigation, or ideas for what kinds of data would round out an 
	 understanding of the visualization as a whole. I prefer that this pullout/ level be done in Processing, however I will consider proposals for visualizations in    	 other environments. 15% of grade. 
 </div>
	 
	 <!--
  - answer the following questions about your data selfie in a text document: 1) What is the data? 2) What are the relationships between the variables? 3) How is the data organized? / How could it be organized? 4) What needs to be communicated? / what is the most interesting? 5) discuss 3 ways of visualizing your data, and what data from your collection you will use (communication over time, mood and platform, network) 6) if you used a pie, bar, or bubble, what data would you use for each kind of visualization?<br />
  - make new sheets (w/in same spreadsheet) with just the data you need for 3 types visualizations (make one location based). Please indicate somewhere what kind of visualization you are envisioning for each sheet. make sure to keep a unique id for each row that is consistent with your original sheet's rows.<br />
   - put all work in a folder called A1b_lastname_firstname. Zip this up so that the file is A1b_lastname_firstname.zip, and email to prof. In the body of the email, include your github username. Due Sept 21<br />
	 .<br /><br />
	 A1c :: Digital Data Selfie Part Three ::
	 Finish mapping some data from your digital data selfie. You can use location to show actual location of communication, or have the map be somewhat abstract, representing platform or receiver, for example. The size of the bubbles should represent some aspect of your data, like amount of use. Consider using color as representing some other aspect of your visual, like dominant mood as related to location. Use TSV or CSV files. Submit work to github. Due Sept 28.
	 
	 <br /><br /><br />
	 
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 2: </span><br />
	 A2 :: Analog Data Selfie :: <br />
	 Begin visualizing your analog communications:
	Document your analog communications for a 24 hour time period. How do you communicate to drivers and bikers when crossing the street on foot, when ordering coffee in a busy shop, or late at night in a rough neighborhood. Consider vocal and non vocal communications. You may use some categories/ metadata that you used for your digital observations, but you will also need to add new ones. Note the difficulty in establishing metadata categories for non-digital communications. Organize your categories in a spreadsheet, TSV, or CSV.
	<br /><br /><br />
	A2b ::<br />
	- Consider your A2a analog communication data. You may work in any visual environment you wish to visualize your non-digital communications. How do you understand context, meaning and shared understanding in these communications? In the next few weeks we will work on visualizing and quantifying this data in various ways, but this week you can be creative and think outside of the box in regards to your visualizations. Share all Processing sketches via the A2b github repository, or send sketches, drawings or vector graphics via email.
	
	 <br /><br /><br />
	<span style="font-size:24px;">Assignment 3: </span><br />
	 A3, Due Dec. 08 <br />
	 
	 <strong>Option 1</strong> :: Data comparisons :: <br />
	  - For this assignment you will consider both the data from A1 and A2, as well as their visualizations. Present <span style="text-decoration:line-through">at least two</span> 1-2 well developed visualizations showing how these data sets are similar and how they are different by making connections and correlating data, using diagram maps, cartographic maps, or other maps or graphs. 
	 <br /> - In writing, you will discuss: 1) how the data from your digital and analog communications are similar and how they diverge. Please explore rationale for the similarities and differences by referencing the readings and lectures on the history of information that have been presented in class. 2) Note any big visual changes and what data causes those changes. 3) Finally, you should not only explain your visualizations, but should also indicate remaining questions that have been unanswered and where more work and refinement needs to be done. <br />
	 <br />
	 
	<strong>Option 2</strong> :: Networks and Systems assignment :: <br />
	 - Work with data from <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov">the NOAA website</a>, the <a href="https://usanpn.org/">National Phenology Network</a> see: <a href="https://www.usanpn.org/results/data">the download data page</a>  (note: you may need to set up an account with <a href="https://www.usanpn.org/natures_notebook">nature's notebook</a> to access this data), or data generated from another site that is concerned with climate, nature, or natural systems to visualize some sort of change over time. <br />
	 - Consider ways besides plotted points to show this change. You may use Processing's built in <a href="https://processing.org/reference/Table.html">Table object</a>, or the simplified Table object used from Ben Fry's sample code that we've worked with earlier in the semester. <br />
	 - Here is <a href="media/A3_Sample.zip">some sample code</a> that uses a simplified data set and the Processing Table object to get you started. Please note that I am looking for a larger data set than this example offers, ideally around 1000 data points.<br />
	 - In writing: 1) discuss the visual changes in your sketch and what data is specifically causing those changes. 2) Indicate any questions about your that have been generated by your data set, any further refinement that could be done, and how you might go about advancing the project. 
	<br /><br />
	Please zip up work and label A3_lastname_firstname.zip and email, or, please branch and then push to the <a href="https://github.com/SCIMA-300/A3">A3 repository on GitHub</a><br />
